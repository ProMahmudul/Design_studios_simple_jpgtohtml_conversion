
//Access Modifiers

The access modifier is the most important feature of the OO language and it is used to restrict the function and classes to be accessed. The list of the access modifiers are:
Public: Class properties and methods, that are set to be public, can be accessed anywhere in the PHP script, in other words everywhere.
Private: Class properties and methods, that are set to be private, can only be accessed within a class, in other words only in which it is defined.
Protected: Class properties and method, that are set to be protected, can only be accessed inside the class and by its subclasses, in other words its class and sub classes.


//Polymorphism
When we start to extend classes, and add functionality to them which wasn't there previously, and even override existing methods (functions), this is called polymorphism.

The basis of polymorphism is Inheritance and overriden methods.

//Encapsulation

Wrapping some data in single unit is called Encapsulation. Encapsulation is used to safe data or information in an object from other it means encapsulation is mainly used for protection purpose.
